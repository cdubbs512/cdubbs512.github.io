I am always open to new consulting opportunities and even fantastic full-time ones. I love challenges that push me and allow me to further develop my expertise to contribute to the growth and success of organizations that share my values.

I have over a decade of experience in providing financial and strategic consulting services to clients across various sectors and regions. I have a strong background in business strategy, business development, M&A, startups, IoT, and data science, and I leverage these skills to help clients achieve their goals and optimize their performance.

I enjoy working on complex and challenging projects that require me to dive deep into a market, data, trends, and industry best practices, and to create and implement innovative and goal-oriented solutions. 

Some of the services I have provided my clients are on advising them on how ti improve their operations, cash flow, and profitability. I have created in-depth market analysis for foreign companies on US market entry, and in contrast have created go-to-market strategies for a large US company entereing new EU markets. I served as a sell-side M&A advisor for a European solar company divesting it's solar fields. 

I also have a passion for learning about the future of technology and AI, as I completed a data science immersive program where I developed predictive machine learning models and worked on pro-bono projects utilizing satellite imagery to prepare Caribbean islands for Hurricanes.

Would love to connect and learn about you.
