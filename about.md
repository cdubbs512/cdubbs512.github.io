I love solving problems at strategic inflection points for companies by bringing human-focused solutions to data-backed problems. Among many things, I have founded a healthcare company, raised venture capital for other companies, completed M&A transactions, and doubled the impact and number of clients served by a non-profit microfinance organization in Peru. 

I am committed to helping people, organizations, and communities bring human-focused solutions to data backed problems. 

With a strong consulting background, I bring a wealth of experience allowing me to clarify objectives, dive into problems, use data to tell its story, and bring solutions to the table that can be enacted within resource constraints.
