I partner with founders and leadership teams to solve complex financial and strategic challenges.

I’m particularly interested in opportunities where finance is not just reporting but a strategic lever for growth.

Over the past decade, I’ve advised companies across industries and geographies on growth strategy, capital allocation, M&A, market expansion, and operational performance.

My background spans management consulting, corporate finance, startups, and independent advisory. I’ve led sell-side M&A engagements, built market entry strategies across the U.S. and Europe, improved cash flow and profitability for scaling businesses, and helped companies turn data into decision-grade insight.

I thrive in ambiguity. Whether entering a new market, preparing for a transaction, or building financial infrastructure for scale, I dive deep—into markets, data, competitive dynamics, and operating models—to design solutions that drive measurable outcomes.

If you're building something meaningful and want a strategic finance partner who thinks like an owner, let’s connect.
