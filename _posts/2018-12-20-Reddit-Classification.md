# Classification modeling to predict if comments came from one of two subreddit threads: /Barca or /RealMadrid

As a fan of the beautiful game, and a passionate azulgrana... ¡Força-Barça! ... I decided for my third General Assembly Data Science Immersive project, to build classification models that identified if a comment was coming from a subreddit dedicated to FC Barcelona or to one for Real Madrid. Call it El Clásico de Reddit. 

To get the data, I webscrapped the two subreddit threads to collect a sufficient number of comments from each and then built the classification models. 

My presentation is as follows and the link to the project can be found here on [GitHub](https://github.com/cdubbs512/reddit_subreddit_classification).
