# Regression modeling to predict Top 5 European Leagues footballers market values ssing 2008 - 2017 data from transfermarkt.co.uk

In this project the problem I'm seeking to understand is how well annual statistics predict the estimated market values of professional footballers in the top 5 European leagues.

Using players annual data to see how applicable machine learning prediction models are on market values.

Data: comes from transfermarket.co.uk which has crowd sourced market values for players in the top flight of European football over the last 10 years. 

My presentation is as follows and the link to the team project can be found here on [GitHub](https://github.com/cdubbs512/capstone).
